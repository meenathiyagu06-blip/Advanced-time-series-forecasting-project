Hybrid Prophet–LSTM Time Series Forecasting Model
This project implements a Hybrid Forecasting Model that combines the strengths of Facebook Prophet (trend + seasonality modeling) with LSTM deep learning (non-linear pattern learning).
It is designed for accurate forecasting of complex time-series data where classical or deep-learning models alone are not sufficient.

Project Overview
Time series data often contains:
Long-term trends
Seasonality patterns
Irregular fluctuations
Non-linear relationships

Traditional statistical models (like Prophet) handle trends and seasonality well, while neural networks (like LSTM) capture non-linear dependencies.
This hybrid model leverages both:
Prophet → Predicts trend + seasonality
LSTM → Learns residuals/errors Prophet cannot capture
Final Forecast = Prophet Forecast + LSTM Predicted Residuals

Key Features
 Hybrid Forecasting: Prophet + LSTM
 Automatically models trend & seasonality
 Sequence learning through LSTM
 Residual learning for improved accuracy
 Configurable LSTM layers and hyperparameters
 Clear project structure
 Easy to run and extend

 Requirements
Install all dependencies:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib prophet tensorflow scikit-learn

Python version recommended: 3.8 – 3.11
TensorFlow version: 2.x

 How the Hybrid Model Works
 Prophet Model
Prophet first fits:

Trend
Yearly/weekly seasonality
Holiday effects (optional)

This generates:

y_prophet → The baseline forecast
residuals = actual - y_prophet
LSTM Model
LSTM is then trained on residual errors, learning:
Non-linear patterns
Temporal dependencies the Prophet model missed

fourhort & long-range relationships

Final Forecast
The final output is:
Hybrid Forecast = Prophet Forecast + LSTM Residual Forecast

This creates a more robust and stable forecast than individual models.

 Usage Instructions
1. Prepare your dataset
The dataset must contain:
